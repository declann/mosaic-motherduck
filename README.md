# Mosaic + MotherDuck Demo

A quick demo application without any additional frameworks of how [Mosaic](https://uwdata.github.io/mosaic/) can work with [MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com) (specifically, the [WebAssembly client library](https://github.com/motherduckdb/wasm-client)).
I built this in an evening which shows how easy it is. It's not super polished but that hopefully makes it easier to understand.
